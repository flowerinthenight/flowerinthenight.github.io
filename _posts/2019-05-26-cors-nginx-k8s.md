title: "Adding CORS support to nginx proxy in Kubernetes"

At work, for a couple of months now, we've been using [Ambassador](https://www.getambassador.io/) as our main API gateway to our k8s services. We also have our own authorization service that uses Ambassador's [AuthService](https://www.getambassador.io/reference/services/auth-service) mechanism. Recently, we've had services that need CORS support and although Ambassador has features that support the [enabling of CORS](https://www.getambassador.io/reference/cors), we had to update our authorization service to handle CORS-related requests. Instead of doing this, we tried adding the CORS support at the proxy level (nginx). I've wrote about this topic [here](https://flowerinthenight.com/blog/2018/03/31/access-pods-k8s) and [here](https://flowerinthenight.com/blog/2019/01/31/nginx-basicauth-k8s).

In the example below, the CORS support is added under the location `/svc2/`.

With that said, be aware of the [potential problems of using if in nginx](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/depth/ifisevil/).
