## Update
[vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go) has already transitioned to [gopls](https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/user.md) as its default completion engine. I just noticed that my Vim is still using [gocode](https://github.com/stamblerre/gocode) even though I updated to the latest version of vim-go. Commenting/removing the line `Plugin 'stamblerre/gocode', {'rtp': 'vim/'}` from my .vimrc did the trick for me. Hope this helps.
