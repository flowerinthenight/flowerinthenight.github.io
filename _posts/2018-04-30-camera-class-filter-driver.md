This post is a bit of a departure from my usual golang/cloud-related ramblings. I posted an open-source [camera class filter driver](https://github.com/flowerinthenight/windows-camera-class-filter-driver) for Windows ages ago hoping that it would help someone working on a similar project. If you are familiar with this type of driver, you probably know that it's not that straightforward to write mainly due to it being generally undocumented. A lot of reverse engineering has been done to write this driver. Anyway, recently, someone pointed out to me that it's been discussed in [this forum post](https://www.osronline.com/showthread.cfm?link=288736). So it you're working on a similar project, give it a whirl, and if you find some issues, I would appreciate it if you could submit a PR for fixes. Thanks.
