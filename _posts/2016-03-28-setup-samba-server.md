I installed Samba to my Ubuntu Server (which is an old ThinkPad laptop that has been gathering dust in my closet for ages):

{% highlight shell %}
sudo apt-get install samba
{% endhighlight %}

I have three 3-TB HDDs that I planned to use as my main server storage; one main server, and the other two for backup. All of these HDDs are in ext4 format.

Then I created a new directory under `/media` where I will mount my main server storage:

{% highlight shell %}
mkdir /media/myserver
{% endhighlight %}

Then I edited the samba config file `/etc/samba/smb.conf`. I just scrolled to the very bottom and added these lines (after [print$] section):

{% highlight conf %}
[MYSERVER]
    path = /media/myserver
    browsable = yes
    writable = yes
    guest ok = yes
    read only = no
{% endhighlight %}

Then I tested the config file for syntax errors using the command:

{% highlight shell %}
testparm
{% endhighlight %}

Before I added the mount entry for my server to `/etc/fstab`, I took note of my HDD's UUID from the following command:

{% highlight shell %}
sudo blkid
{% endhighlight %}

in which the output looked something like

{% highlight shell %}
/dev/sdb1: UUID="996a1b79-bf22-49fd-a3d1-33eab2708cfb" TYPE="ext4"
{% endhighlight %}

Then I edited `/etc/fstab` and added the line below:

{% highlight shell %}
UUID=996a1b79-bf22-49fd-a3d1-33eab2708cfb /media/myserver ext4 defaults 0 0
{% endhighlight %}
               
Lastly, I then rebooted my server.

# Accessing my file server from Windows

To access my server, I opened File Explorer and browsed to `\\my_server_ip\myserver`.
