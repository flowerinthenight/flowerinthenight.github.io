# Compiling the manifest file

This is how I compiled my manifest file.

* Open Visual Studio command prompt.
* Compile manifest file.

{% highlight shell %}
mc -um <manifest_file>.man
{% endhighlight %}

When successful, output files are:

{% highlight shell %}
<filename>.h
<filename>.rc
<filename>TEMP.BIN
MSG00001.bin
{% endhighlight %}

# Creating the message resource DLL

I like to create a separate dll just for the manifest file resource although you can also add the .rc file to any of your existing dll or exe.

## Compile .rc to .res

{% highlight shell %}
rc <filename>.rc
{% endhighlight %}

## Create .dll from .res

{% highlight shell %}
link -dll -noentry -out:<out>.dll <filename>.res
{% endhighlight %}

# Register the manifest to the system (optional)

I always register the manifest file on my development systems. As for client systems, its up to you. I dont.

Open admin command prompt and execute

{% highlight shell %}
wevtutil im <manifest_file>.man /rf:"full_path_to_resource_dll" /mf:"full_path_to_resource_dll"
{% endhighlight %}

# Remove the manifest from the system

Open admin command prompt and execute

{% highlight shell %}
wevtutil um <manifest_file>.man
{% endhighlight %}
