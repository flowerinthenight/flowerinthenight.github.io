I am a fan of the [Minimalis](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1112273/) [conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky) config for quite some time now. I've tweaked it a little bit due to the original config not displaying some of the information. Mind you, my system is Linux-based (Pop!_OS) using wired connection only, no WIFI, so I've removed the WIFI section and replaced it with the wired one. Here's a screenshot of it from my desktop.

The full configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/flowerinthenight/.files/blob/master/conky.conf), in case you're interested. Changes as far as I can remember are the addition of additional CPU cores, both CPU and GPU temperatures, processes, and network.
