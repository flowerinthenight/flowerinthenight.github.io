As of this writing, GitHub Pages still doesn't support HTTPS for custom domains. Last week, I came across [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/github-pages-vs-netlify/) being able to serve GitHub Pages as is, with HTTPS support even with custom domains. I gave it a go. And it worked. If you're in the same boat as me (using GH-Pages with custom domains), give [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) a go.

Note: I am not affiliated with Netlify in any way, whatsoever.
