Check out the codes in [GitHub](https://github.com/idrilsilverfoot/win32-etw-manifest).

If you remember in part 2, we compiled our manifest file with

{% highlight shell %}
mc -um <manifest_file>.man
{% endhighlight %}

and we got a header file as one of the outputs. We just have to include that header file to our sources and we are good to go.

{% highlight cpp %}
#include ...
#include "<manifest_file>.h"

int main(...)
{
    EventRegister<provider_name_in_manifest>();
    ...
    CreateFile(...);
    // Example of using the LastError event in our manifest file
    EventWriteLastError(L"THIS_EXE", __FILE__, __FUNC__, L"CreateFile", GetLastError());
    ...
    EventUnregister<provider_name_in_manifest>();
}
{% endhighlight %}

# Notes

* Any module can use the ETW provider, be it dll or exe, simultaneously. But you can also create a provider for each module if you prefer. 
* For a dll, you can call the `EventRegister()` inside your `DllMain` -> `DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH` and your `EventUnregister()` in `DLL_PROCESS_DETACH`.
