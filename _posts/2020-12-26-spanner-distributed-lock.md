I uploaded a yet another distributed locking library, this time, based on [Cloud Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/) and [TrueTime](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/true-time-external-consistency) technology. It's called `spindle` and you can find the code [here](https://github.com/flowerinthenight/spindle/). Maybe it will be useful to anybody out there.
