My name is Chew. I'm a Software Engineer working for Lenovo, Japan. I do mostly Windows driver code, libraries, frameworks, and embedded stuff. Nothing special really. Just your average coder. And Ive been doing this for eleven (or so) years now.<br/><br/>
Welcome to my blog, by the way. Here, youll find mostly uninteresting tech howtos and some random bits and bobs about my uninteresting life as well. If you want a dose of uninterestingness in your overwhelmingly superb life, then browse away!<br/><br/>
Lastly, why Flowerinthenight? Good question. If you are thinking about Flowerinthenight, the princess from Diana Wynne Jones' [Castle In The Air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_in_the_Air_(novel)), then you are right. Congratulations! Anyway, it goes without saying that shes one of my favorite book characters of all time. Seriously, I cant think of any other princess with a name as fantastic as hers.
