Hi. My name is Chew. I'm a Software Engineer working for Lenovo, Japan. I do mostly Windows driver code, libraries, frameworks, and embedded stuff. Nothing special really. Just your average coder. And I've been doing this for eleven (or so) years now.

Welcome to my blog, by the way. Here, youll find mostly uninteresting tech howtos and some random bits and bobs about my uninteresting life as well. If you want a dose of uninterestingness in your overwhelmingly superb life, then browse away!

Lastly, why Flowerinthenight? Good question. If you are thinking about Flowerinthenight, the princess from Diana Wynne Jones' [Castle In The Air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_in_the_Air_(novel)), then you are right. Congratulations! Anyway, it goes without saying that she's one of my favorite book characters of all time. Seriously, I can't think of any other princess with a name as fantastic as hers.
