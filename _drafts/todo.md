* role as auth for aws sdk
* blog vim
* emacs journey
  * vim user for 15yrs, but still uses arrow keys, trying emacs/spacemacs for about 3months now
  * spacemacs is brilliant in every way other than performance
  * niggle: visual mode, s = surround, not edit
  * osx to pop-os to try spacemacs improvement in performance
  * now spacemacs in linux is working great, not probably because of linux, but specs
  * tried the terminal version, not as good
  * vim is still the best
